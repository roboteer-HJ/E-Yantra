This folder contains tutorial on Image processing. 
Each folder contains video tutorial and code used in the tutorial. 

This tutorial is based on learn by doing philosophy. So for practising the code we have provided the tutorial_playground folder which only contains images and template files. So students have to change the template code as shown in the tutorial videos. If you face any problems in coding you can take help from the code provided in the respective tutorial folder.
